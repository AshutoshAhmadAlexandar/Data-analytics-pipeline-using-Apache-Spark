LONDON —  British energy supplier Centrica will launch a local energy market trial later this year using blockchain technology, it said on Monday. Blockchain provides a secure platform for consumers to buy and sell directly from each other and is being explored by several European utilities which say it could revolutionise the energy sector. Centrica said its trial is likely to be the largest blockchain project in Britain carried out by one of the big six energy suppliers. The project will test a range of energy trading transactions including multi-party peer-to-peer trading between 200 businesses and residential participants, it said.

Centrica is also working on a trial in Texas with LO3 Energy of what it said would be the world's first micro-hedging market for business customers.
