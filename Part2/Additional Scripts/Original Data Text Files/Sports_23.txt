Advertisement By VICTOR MATHERJUNE 8, 2017  With two and a half minutes left in Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals on Wednesday night, Cleveland led by 6 points, 113-107, and had the ball. The Cavs were poised to get right back in the series. Then it all went wrong. A look at the fateful last minutes that took the Warriors to a 3-0 series lead and the brink of the N.B.A. title. 2:33 to go: J.R. Smith, who had made a 3-pointer to give the Cavs their 6-point lead, takes another, a tad off balance, from the baseline with the shot clock at 2. After taking only four 3-pointers in Games 1 and 2, Smith took all 10 of his shots in this game from beyond the arc and made five of them. This one missed. LeBron James got the rebound. The Cavs’ rebounding had been expected to be a strength in the series, and they finished the game with 59 boards, 15 of them offensive. But you’ve got to make the follow-up shots. James got the ball to Love for a layup. He was directly under the basket, but as he jumped the ball flew harmlessly straight into the air. Love made a gesture of puzzlement afterward; perhaps Draymond Green caused him to lose control. Green got the ball and headed the other way. Advertisement 2:19: Perfect transition basketball. Curry drove the lane before the Cavs could get any kind of defensive setup, and scored. Kyle Korver, not known as a defensive player, made a vague and ineffectual flap at him as he sailed by. The Warriors were within 4 points, 113-109. Advertisement 1:52: Kyrie Irving did some fancy dribbling, drove to the basket and took a one-handed driving layup. It was a little off balance, but was still the kind of shot that often goes in. It bounced tantalizingly on the rim for a few seconds, and went out. Irving atoned by diving for the rebound. It was time to get the ball to James, and he got a shot, a fadeaway midrange jumper. It missed too, and Durant rebounded for the Warriors. 1:15: After a timeout, Durant drove by a slow-footed Tristan Thompson and got a short pull-up jumper. No problem. The Warriors had cut it to a 2-point margin, 113-111. Now Cleveland needed a timeout. 52.5 seconds: The Cavs still had the lead and the ball, it was no time to panic. Korver was acquired in January for one reason: To make 3-point shots. He was open. He missed, completing a 2-for-6 night from long range. “Man, got a great look,” he said after the game. “That’s one I’ll be replaying.” Durant got another rebound. 45.3: Durant brought the ball down, reached the 3-point line and didn’t hesitate. James got a late hand in his face, but the 3 went in. When the Warriors acquired Durant last year, some rashly said the 2017 title was already decided. Shots like this one make them look prescient. The Warriors took the lead for first time since the third quarter, 114-113,.              Lebron kicks out to Korver, Durant takes the ball shoots a 3 over Lebron. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/GH59aOzb3Y  26.5: Irving tried another shot. It was not a good one: a step back contested by Klay Thompson. Curry got the rebound. 12.9: Korver fouled Durant and he made two free throws to take the lead to 3 points, 116-113. 12.4: There was still time for the game’s best player to rescue the Cavs. James needed a 3, and he tried to take one at the baseline. But Andre Iguodala blocked it, and the ball went out of bounds off Cleveland.              Andre Iguodala's block on LeBron is poetic. One season everything goes wrong for you and now you're back to being a hero. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/CMQd77T1Kx  A foul and two Curry free throws out the Warriors up 5 and locked up the game, which had only enough time for Love to miss a 3. The Warriors had outscored the Cavaliers by 11-0, with 7 of those points coming from Durant.
