Advertisement Supported by By Victor Mather With a 118-113 N.B.A. finals Game 3 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night, the Golden State Warriors closed in on the N.B.A. championship. And they closed in on history. They have a chance to be the first team to go through the playoffs undefeated. Should they succeed with a win Friday night in Cleveland, they would complete back-to-back seasons to remember: the greatest regular season record ever (73-9 in 2015-16) followed by the greatest playoff record ever. Indeed, their playoff run would stand as probably the greatest in any major North American sport. Previously, the best N.B.A. playoff record belonged to the 2000-1 Lakers of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. They raced through the first three rounds undefeated, lost Game 1 of the finals to Allen Iverson and the 76ers, then won four straight for a 15-1 record. In a three-round playoff format, the 1982-83 Sixers were 12-1, nearly making good on Moses Malone’s prediction of “four, four, four.” The sport with the most similar playoff format to basketball is hockey. No team has swept through the Stanley Cup playoffs in its current four-round format; the record belongs to the 1988 Oilers (Gretzky, Messier, Kurri) who were 16-2-1. (The tie came because of a power failure in the Boston Garden.) Earlier records all belong to the Canadiens. The 1976 and 1968 teams each had only one loss in a three-round format. The 1960 Canadiens were the last team to be undefeated in the postseason, though the playoffs were just two rounds then. Under the current baseball format, the closest teams to perfection were the 2005 White Sox and 1999 Yankees, who each lost just once in three rounds. Tie goes to the White Sox, who were winning their first title since 1917. Their only loss, to the Angels in the League Championship Series, came by a single run. In the older two-round format, the 1976 Big Red Machine in Cincinnati was undefeated in seven games. The N.F.L. playoffs is single elimination, so by definition all winning teams are undefeated. As for dominance, it would be tough to match the Bears of 1985, who won their three playoff games by 21-0, 24-0, and 46-10. Major League Soccer is a young league, with a shifting playoff format. The 2011 Galaxy are the only team who were undefeated and untied in regulation time in the playoffs, leading to David Beckham’s first M.L.S. Cup. Several teams have been unbeaten in the W.N.B.A. playoffs, most recently the Minnesota Lynx in 2013 at 7-0. The Warriors are likely to be favored by about three points in Friday’s game. Should they finish a staggering fourth consecutive sweep, they will have put up a mark that teams in any sport will find extraordinarily difficult to rival.
