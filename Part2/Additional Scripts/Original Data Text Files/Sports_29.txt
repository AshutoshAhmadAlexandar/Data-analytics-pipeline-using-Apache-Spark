Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAJUNE 10, 2017  CLEVELAND — It was impossible. It was inconceivable. There was no way the Cavaliers could escape from the wreckage of this series and slow the Golden State Warriors’ march to immortality. The Cavaliers heard all the doubts ahead of Friday’s Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals. The noise was impossible to ignore. But with every dazzling layup by Kyrie Irving and each impassioned fist pump from LeBron James, the Cavaliers and their fans at Quicken Loans Arena found hope, a commodity that had been in short supply. In a game played at a breakneck pace, and one that seemed to have more physical contact than a taekwondo tournament, the Cavaliers stunned the Warriors, 137-116, to stay alive in the series. “Believeland is not going to give up,” Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said, referring to the nickname adopted by the Cleveland fan base. “We’re going to keep fighting. We’re going to keep scrapping.” Advertisement The Warriors lead the best-of-seven series by three games to one, and they will have another opportunity to clinch the title in Game 5 on Monday in Oakland, Calif. But the loss was a missed opportunity for the Warriors — not only to celebrate a championship on Cleveland’s home court, but to do something no team in league history had ever done: sweep its way to a perfect record in the postseason. “I think we played a desperate team on their home floor, a great team with great players, and they came out and handed it to us,” Golden State Coach Steve Kerr said. “Simple as that.” Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

The Cavaliers dealt the Warriors their first defeat since April 10, in their second-to-last game of the regular season. It was a night for the Cavaliers to feel good about themselves again, although it all came with a caveat: No team has come back from a three-games-to-none series deficit to win the finals. The Cavaliers are glad they have an opportunity to become the first. “You hear some chatter going on throughout the Warriors locker room in terms of them trying to end it here,” Irving said, adding, “We had to leave it all out there.” Advertisement Irving, the Cavaliers’ acrobatic point guard, scored 40 points, and James, their all-world forward, finished with his second triple-double of the series: 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Kevin Love added 23 points for the Cavaliers, who shot 52.9 percent from the field. J. R. Smith had five of the team’s 24 3-pointers, which were a finals record. The Cavaliers seem to thrive in adverse situations. “I don’t like it,” James said. “It causes too much stress, man. I’m stressed out. Keep doing this every year. But listen, at the end of the day, we just got some resilient guys.” After scoring 49 points in the first quarter and 86 points in the first half — both N.B.A. postseason records — the Cavaliers survived a frantic third quarter. James threw a pass off the backboard to himself for a dunk. Kevin Durant later jawed with him, drawing security personnel onto the court. (“We were just talking,” Durant said.) Draymond Green was ejected — and then un-ejected, after it was determined that an earlier technical foul had been incorrectly assessed to him instead of Kerr.              WOW. pic.twitter.com/T2BjBdRvTJ  There was more: Zaza Pachulia, the Warriors’ starting center, appeared to strike the Cavaliers’ Iman Shumpert in the midsection during a scrum. Both were assessed technicals. In other words, it was a big mess. But the Cavaliers emerged from the muck with a 115-96 lead entering the fourth quarter, which proved too much for even the Warriors to overcome. “I was hoping they would get tired,” Kerr said of Irving and James, “but they didn’t seem to get tired tonight. They were phenomenal.” The Cavaliers played suffocating defense on Stephen Curry, limiting him to 4-of-13 shooting. Durant scored a team-high 35 points, and Green had 16 points and 14 rebounds. “Just one of those games,” Curry said. “Not going to overreact to one. Obviously, I can play better and want to play better and will play better.” Advertisement As game time approached, crowds formed outside the arena. But the general direction of the series had put a damper on the festivities. The air seemed thick with resignation. A sandwich board at a restaurant made a sad plea: “Cleveland Don’t Quit!” The Cavaliers were coming off a 118-113 loss in Wednesday’s Game 3, a heartbreaking result that put them in a giant hole. James and Irving had combined for 77 points, yet the Cavaliers still lost. Another title for the Warriors seemed inevitable, and perhaps it still does, though the Cavaliers rallied from a three-games-to-one series deficit to wrest a title away from Golden State last year. And the Cavaliers have pride. Lue said he could sense the team’s focus at its pregame shootaround. “Had a great vibe,” he said. “Guys were upbeat. There wasn’t no hanging heads or sadness. Guys were into it.” On Friday, Smith and Irving opened the game with back-to-back 3-pointers. The Cavaliers were not going to back down. Later, James drove to the hoop, absorbed contact and scored on a layup. He punctuated the play by pumping his fist — once, twice, three times — and “M.V.P.” chants filled the building as he went to the foul line. Kerr needed just 2 minutes 44 seconds of the first quarter to elapse before he called his first timeout. It did little good. The Cavaliers quickly pushed their lead to 17, and the Warriors augmented their opponent’s hot shooting by getting into foul trouble. Curry, Green and Klay Thompson picked up two fouls apiece, and the Cavaliers had a 49-33 lead at the end of the first quarter. “They made some tough ones,” Durant said. When the Warriors threatened in the second quarter, trimming the lead to 12, Smith connected on a 3-pointer from 30 feet with the shot clock winding down. The lead was back to 20 when James pulled up for a short jumper, and the crowd — so forlorn just two days before — went bananas. Irving and James combined for 50 points while shooting 18 of 25 from the field as the Cavaliers surged to an 86-68 halftime lead. The Cavaliers had scored 91 points in all of Game 1. Given the long odds facing the Cavaliers and the strength of their opponent, their overall effort was nothing short of extraordinary. Now, the hard part: doing it three more times.
