Westbrook squared up to Gobert as he was waiting to check into the game on Monday. The NBA investigated whether Westbrook left the bench to pursue the altercation, which could have led to a suspension, but it decided only to hand out the fine as well as a post-game technical foul.  Utah leads the best-of-seven series 3-1. The Thunder host Game Five on Wednesday.   (Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Rutherford) Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
