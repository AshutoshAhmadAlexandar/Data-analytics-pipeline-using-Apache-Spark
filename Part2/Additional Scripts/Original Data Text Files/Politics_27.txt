Advertisement By EILEEN SULLIVANMAY 7, 2018  WASHINGTON — President Trump trained his rancor on federal investigators on Monday and appeared to warn that negative material would emerge about the prosecutors leading the inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. In a series of Twitter posts on Monday, the president said the investigation was being run by Democrats and raised the question of whether the special counsel’s work was being drawn out to influence the outcome of the upcoming midterm congressional elections when Democrats could win enough seats to take control of the House and possibly the Senate. “Just wait ’till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest,” Mr. Trump wrote in one of the early morning tweets.              The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!         The veiled threat to the special counsel leading the inquiry and the suggestion of bias comes at a time when Mr. Trump’s legal team seems to be struggling to present a consistent message to the American public.              Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!         The Republicans could lose control of the House and possibly the Senate in the upcoming elections, in part because of growing disapproval of the job Mr. Trump is doing. Mr. Trump’s approval rating is at 41 percent, the lowest of presidents at this point in their first terms since former President Jimmy Carter, who had a 40.5 percent approval rating at a comparable time in his administration.

The special counsel’s office on Monday declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s question. Advertisement Mr. Trump regularly attacks the ongoing investigation, as he did on Monday, and has considered firing Mr. Mueller — a looming threat that has divided the Republican Party. Mr. Trump has recently taken the position that what the special counsel is investigating as possible obstruction of justice is, in reality, Mr. Trump fighting back against what he considers to be false accusations. The president has said that the investigation is led by Democrats, even though Mr. Mueller is a longtime Republican. In another tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump said the Russia investigation is “rapidly losing credibility” and referred to the Republican findings of the House Intelligence Committee — specifically that in a yearlong investigation, Republicans on the committee found there was no collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. Democrats on the committee issued a dissenting document.              The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it’s called Fighting Back         Last year, the chairman of the panel Devin Nunes, of California, stepped away from leading the Russia investigation over questions about his own credibility to run a fair and bipartisan inquiry. Mr. Trump has previously railed about 13 “hardened” Democrats on the special counsel team. At least 17 of the attorneys on the team have contributed to Democratic campaigns, according to records maintained by the Federal Election Commission. And three of the attorneys are registered Democrats, according to reports in the Washington Post and PolitiFact. But the political leanings of the other 14 are unclear. On Sunday, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s attorneys, also suggested there are problems with the government’s investigation. “There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I happen to believe it’s greater than anybody realizes. Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.” Advertisement Mr. Giuliani referenced a federal judge’s recent criticism of the special counsel’s fraud case against Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said on Friday that Mr. Mueller was more interested in Mr. Manafort providing incriminating details about Mr. Trump than he is in Mr. Manafort’s fraud charges.
