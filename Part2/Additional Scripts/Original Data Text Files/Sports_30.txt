Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJUNE 1, 2017  In a postseason in which they have seen little to no competition, the Golden State Warriors kept right on rolling and tied the N.B.A. record for consecutive postseason wins at 13 with a 113-91 drubbing of the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 1 of the N.B.A finals. The Warriors’ Big Four lineup only got significant offensive contributions from two of its members, but that was still far too much for LeBron James and the Cavaliers’ other stars. Looking like they had something to prove, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry put on a show in Game 1, combining for 66 points, 18 assists and 14 rebounds. On defense the Warriors employed the strategy that worked so well in 2015, letting James operate as a one-man show. The game’s best player hardly disappointed with 28 points, 15 rebounds and 8 assists despite being guarded closely by Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala all game, but he did not get nearly enough help from any of his teammates outside of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and did plenty of damage to his own team’s chances by committing 8 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. ■ Much was made of Kevin Durant’s explosion in his return to the finals, but Stephen Curry was nearly as impressive, scoring 28 points to go with 8 assists and 6 rebounds. As he did all season, and throughout the playoffs, Curry led his team in plus/minus, with the Warriors outscoring the Cavaliers by 20 points in his 34 minutes of playing time. Durant was second on the Warriors with a plus-16 while every single member of the Cavaliers recorded a negative score in that category.

While Draymond Green and Klay Thompson provided plenty of value on the defensive end, the team will likely need more than their 9 and 6 points going forward. Thompson was especially bad on offense, shooting just 3 of 16 from the field and missing all five of his 3-point attempts. When Thompson is playing well, opposing defenses get spread dangerously thin, but if Cleveland decides Thompson is truly not a threat they may be able to put more pressure on Curry and Durant. Advertisement ■ The Cavaliers got plenty of production from LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, but the Warriors’ stifling defense completely eliminated the rest of the Cavaliers. Chief among the missing contributors was Kyle Korver, the sharpshooter that Cleveland acquired mid-season to create floor-space. At this stage of his career Korver is on the court almost entirely for his shooting, but he was a ghost in the game, chewing up 20 minutes while taking just three shots and missing all of them. If the Cavaliers cannot find open looks for Korver they need to replace him on the court with someone who contributes more in terms of defense or playmaking. ■ Rebounding has been a chief concern for the Warriors in each of their last two Finals appearances, with Tristan Thompson outclassing the smaller Golden State players repeatedly. The Cavaliers’ starting center was a non-factor in Game 1, pulling down just 4 rebounds in 22 minutes and not scoring any points. The disappearing act resulted in Golden State keeping their rebounding disadvantage to a reasonable 59-50 despite Kevin Love pulling down 21 and James chipping in with 15. Thompson was especially missed in terms of offensive rebounding, where he is among the best in the game at extending possessions. For Cleveland’s offense, which shot 34.9 percent from the field in Game 1, to keep pace with the Warriors they will need Thompson to provide those second chances following missed shots. ■ Anyone taking too much from the result of this game should look into last year’s Games 1 and 2 in which Golden State won by 15 and 33 points. From that point forward the Cavaliers outscored the Warriors by 52 points while winning four of five games to steal the championship. Both teams have appeared rusty thus far, with missed layups on both ends of the court, some quick fouls on both sides, and several players appearing frustrated. For all of the scorers available for both teams, it was Zaza Pachulia who scored the most over the game’s first three minutes, with his four points matching Cleveland’s total. Golden State finally got its normal offense going with an alley-oop from Draymond Green to Kevin Durant, but Cleveland has kept pace and the score was 12-12 near the midpoint of the first quarter. The Warriors, trying to get things going on their home court, have already tried to shake things up by bringing Andre Iguodala in for Green, who picked up two fouls, including a particularly egregious one on the offensive end. As expected, Coach Steve Kerr was once again ruled out of being on the bench with the Warriors as a result of his lengthy recovery from a series of issues with his back. It is unclear if he will be able to return for any games in the finals. After a mid-range jumper from Stephen Curry got Golden State out of a little funk, the Warriors showed off some newfound offensive diversity with a pair of powerful dunks by Kevin Durant that helped erase a three-point lead that Cleveland had opened up. But Cleveland has not lowered their intensity at all, with their defenders punching at the ball going for steals and their offensive players aggressively trying to get to the basket. Advertisement The benches for both teams are starting to see some action, which will change the strategy some for both sides, with the Warriors bringing in JaVale McGee, their top rim protector other than Draymond Green, and the Cavaliers bringing in Deron Williams, their best playmaker off the bench. The first quarter closed with the Warriors leading the Cavaliers 35-30, with Andre Iguodala sinking a 3-pointer at the buzzer to open up his team’s largest lead of the game. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 10 points each (Durant also has 5 assists), but LeBron James was absolutely relentless on the other end, scoring 13 points and almost single-handedly keeping his team in the game, with nearly every Warriors shot for much of the quarter being answered with one of his own. The Warriors are shooting well after a rough start, but it is their success on offensive rebounds which has been the biggest key for them, as they have repeatedly been scoring on second chances. After so much talk about LeBron James resting this season, the juggernaut of a forward played all 12 minutes of the first quarter and was back out scoring the first two points of the second quarter as Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry took a seat on the bench to stay fresh. Golden State has typically struggled with both of their best scorers on the bench, but Draymond Green came back into the game and kept things moving, while Andre Iguodala went about disrupting James. On a possession that could portend bad things for James in terms of how the game is being called, Iguodala wrestled the ball out of his hands, with no foul call despite plenty of contact. James finally took a break shortly after, having played the game’s first 14 minutes. With James on the bench, and Golden State’s lead starting to build, the Cavaliers are still searching for a reliable offensive performer beyond James and Kyrie Irving. Kevin Love is third on the team with 5 points but has been mostly silent since a good start to the game. James came back with 7:26 left in the half with his team trailing, 41-34. After a brief visit to the bench, LeBron James got his team’s offense moving again and is now up to 17 points and 9 rebounds. Advertisement But the herculean efforts by James and Kyrie Irving (who had a nifty 4-point play and is up to 15 points) have not been enough to keep pace with the Warriors, who have opened up a 10-point lead with just over 3 minutes left in the second quarter. A big problem for Cleveland, beyond the rebounding issues they have had, has been turnovers. They have turned the ball over 8 times (including 3 by James) while Golden State has turned the ball over just once. Considering the Warriors’ reputation for overly-flashy play that leads to losing the ball, the disparity is definitely notable.              .@KyrieIrving says count it from DEEP! #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/RyBdiOU9mv  In a first half that was not nearly as sharp as either team would have preferred, the Warriors went into the locker room leading the Cavaliers 60-52. Kevin Durant may be the new guy in town — and he has certainly lived up to his advance billing with 23 points, 6 assists and 4 rebounds — but the script for the first half of this game seemed ripped right out of last year’s finals with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving valiantly battling to keep pace with a far deeper Golden State lineup.

James and Irving combined for 36 points in the half, but the rest of the Cavaliers combined for just 16. The Warriors appear to be comfortable letting James get to the basket, with Durant and Andre Iguodala making him work hard for his points while their teammates shut the rest of the Cleveland roster down entirely. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the game, though, has been the Warriors keeping things so close to the basket. The team that has the reputation for living and dying by the 3-pointer went just 3 for 13 from 3-point range, but was still able to succeed thanks to 11 offensive rebounds and a number of strong plays close to the basket from Durant, who already has set a career-high in a playoff game with six dunks. For Cleveland to make up the gap in the second half, they will need to reduce their turnovers, stop letting Golden State get second-chance baskets on offense, and will need to find some way to slow down Durant. The Warriors opened up the second half by forcing yet another Cleveland turnover and then having Kevin Durant knock down a 3-pointer on the other end of the court. Some sloppy mistakes on the offensive end by Cleveland, a shot tossed up by Zaza Pachulia that miraculously found the basket, and a mid-range jumper by Stephen Curry and suddenly Golden State’s lead has stretched to 15 points with just under 10 minutes left in the third quarter. The Cavaliers are up to 15 turnovers. Advertisement The Warriors built their lead to 21 points but Cleveland’s offense woke up enough to narrow it back to a 15-point gap despite Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry being up to a combined 46 points. Amid a solid lead for Golden State, there still has to be some concern about the play of Klay Thompson, who has shot just 2 for 12 from the field for 4 points. Thompson has been in a funk for most of the playoffs, and that has continued on the offensive end in Game 1, though he has remained a tenacious defender on the other end of the court. If anything, Thompson’s struggles illustrate why the Warriors wanted to add a player like Durant to the mix who is less prone to hot streaks and cold streaks. Many have blamed last year’s collapse on a cold streak by Curry, but a similar one by Thompson this year has barely slowed the Warriors down thanks to Durant. Golden State committed a few turnovers, and Cleveland kept pressing on offense, narrowing the gap all the way to 12 points, but the run was short-lived. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry continued to press things on the offensive end, leading the Warriors on a 10-0 run to end the third quarter with a 21-point advantage. Curry, who hit a long 3-pointer in transition over J.R. Smith late in the quarter, followed up the shot with a high-stepping celebration down the court. With that play in particular, he was looking more like the two-time M.V.P. and less like the meek performer who was outmatched throughout last year’s finals. With a quarter to play, he has 26 points and 8 assists while shooting 6 for 11 from 3-point range. LeBron James has picked up three fouls to go with his seven turnovers and is openly showing frustration on the court, yelling at the officials after Draymond Green appeared to commit an offensive foul against him with no call. For all three years he has coached the Warriors, Steve Kerr has been frustrated with his team’s tendency to lose concentration and commit needless turnovers to let opposing teams back into the game. In their first finals game with Kerr in the locker room rather than on the bench, the team is doing their coach proud, with just 4 turnovers against 26 assists and 10 steals. They are playing the efficient game Kerr has always preached while forcing Cleveland to commit 16 turnovers. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Go to Home Page »
