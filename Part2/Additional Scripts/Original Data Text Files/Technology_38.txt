Whatever you’re doing, take a minute, or a bit more, and indulge in some great journalism. Happy New Year! The magazine embarks on its annual remembrance of some of the artists, innovators and thinkers we lost in the past year. The collection includes essays on Mary Tyler Moore, Chuck Berry, Dick Gregory and Sam Shepard (whose hat is pictured above). Magazine _____ Trump versus Hollywood. Echoes of the Confederacy. Taylor Swift and the alt-right. Here’s a not-so-nostalgic look back at some of the year’s fiercest fights. Arts & Leisure _____ Oaxaca has become popular during the holiday season when the temperate weather, the food and the festive spirit attract travelers from near and far. Travel _____ Most chefs work a lifetime for a Michelin star. Jérôme Brochot is giving his back. Why? He can’t afford it. Neither can his declining old mining town. International _____ The victims of sexual harassment who have recently come forward are far from alone: Nearly half of women say they have experienced some form of it at work at least once in their careers. But there has been little research about those responsible. In a new survey, about a third of men said they had done something at work within the past year that would qualify as objectionable behavior or sexual harassment. Upshot _____ With hits for Drake, Rihanna and Maroon 5, an intensely private woman is the secret queen of streaming. Arts _____ Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi, will be inhabited in January, signaling tech’s triumph in the city. Business _____ Bombs made in Sardinia are being used in Yemen’s civil war by Saudi Arabia, some of them in attacks on civilians. Italy isn’t the only country arming Saudi Arabia, but an investigation by The Times uncovered a massive increase in the export of these bombs in 2017. Video _____ He is the beating heart of British basketball, and his journey has taken him from the Bronx to Buckingham Palace. And, at 44, he is still going. “In his mind, age doesn’t apply.” Sports _____ Every new technology gets a game that helps bring it careening into the mainstream. Social networks had FarmVille. Mobile phones had Angry Birds. And, its investors hope, blockchain has CryptoKitties. Blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Ethereum, ledgers for recording virtual currency transactions, is booming, and CryptoKitties is the first big blockchain game. Styles _____ The Times reporter John Leland started following the lives of six New Yorkers over the age of 85, one of the fastest-growing age groups in America. He found that when the elders described their lives, they focused not on their declining abilities but on things that they could still do and that they found rewarding.
