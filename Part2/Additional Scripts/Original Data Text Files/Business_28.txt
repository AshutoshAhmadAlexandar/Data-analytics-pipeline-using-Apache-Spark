Advertisement Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re “Mr. Trump’s Destructive Trade War” (editorial, March 4): You warn that a trade war including tariffs on steel imports that President Trump wants imposed might harm workers in American steel-using industries like autos, and you say these tariffs will send the United States into a “broader trade war, the likes of which the world hasn’t seen since the Great Depression.” In fact, we have been in trade wars for many years. When China subsidized the investment into enormous excess steel-producing capacity that could be got rid of only by dumping it on world markets, it was in effect declaring a trade war. When China adopted the policy of everything “made in China 2025,” it was declaring a trade war. When Japan allowed its auto producers to control the auto distributors, it was declaring a trade war. When China said Google and Facebook could not operate in China, it was declaring a trade war, and moreover, also declaring an ideological war. Conventional free-trade wisdom has little to do with reality. CLYDE PRESTOWITZ, KULA, HAWAII The writer was chief United States trade negotiator with Japan in the Reagan administration.
